# FLC Sheep Seeking - Login Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Issue
**Problem:** The login API was trying to query a `year` column from the `groups` table that doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Updated `/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` to:
- Remove `year` column from SQL queries to the `groups` table  
- Set a default year value (2025) when group information is retrieved
- Handle null values properly by converting them to `undefined`

### 2. Admin Role Routing
**Problem:** Admins were being routed to a non-existent `/stream-leader` page instead of the sheep seeker dashboard.

**Solution:** Updated `/app/page.tsx` routing logic:
- Admins now route to `/sheep-seeker` (full edit access)
- Leaders route to `/sheep-seeker` (view-only access)
- Lead Pastor routes to `/sheep-seeker` (view all groups)
- Super Admin routes to `/super-admin`

### 3. Terminology Updates
- Updated login page text from "Only authorized Sheep Seekers and Super Admins can log in" to "Only authorized users can log in"
- Clarified role descriptions in routing comments

## User Credentials

All user passwords follow the pattern: `{Month}{Role}2025!`

### Examples:
- **January Admin:** `january_admin` / `JanuaryAdmin2025!`
- **January Leader:** `january_leader` / `JanuaryLeader2025!`
- **Lead Pastor:** `leadpastor` / `LeadPastor2025!`

See `USER_CREDENTIALS.txt` for complete list of all 25 users.

## Role Permissions

| Role | Access Level | Dashboard |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Admin** | Full edit access for assigned month | `/sheep-seeker` |
| **Leader** | View-only for assigned month | `/sheep-seeker` |
| **Lead Pastor** | View all months (read-only) | `/sheep-seeker` |
| **Super Admin** | Full system access | `/super-admin` |

## Testing Login

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter username: `january_admin`
3. Enter password: `JanuaryAdmin2025!`  
4. Click "Sign In"
5. You should be redirected to the sheep seeker dashboard

## Next Steps

If login still fails:
1. Check the terminal output for specific error messages
2. Verify the password is exactly as shown (case-sensitive, includes special characters)
3. Make sure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
4. Clear browser cache and try again

## Files Modified

- `/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Fixed database queries and null handling
- `/app/page.tsx` - Updated routing for all user roles  
- `/lib/auth.ts` - Added error handling to password verification
