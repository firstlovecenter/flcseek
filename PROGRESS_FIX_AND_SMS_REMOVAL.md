# Progress Tracker Fix & SMS Feature Removal

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Progress Tracker Not Showing 15 Stages ✅

**Problem:**
- Users reported that the progress tracker was not showing all 15 stages
- Investigation revealed that most people in the database (120 out of 121) had no progress records initialized

**Root Cause:**
- People were registered before the progress record initialization logic was added
- Or they were bulk-imported without progress records

**Solution:**
1. Created `scripts/check-progress-records.ts` to diagnose the issue
2. Created `scripts/initialize-progress-records.ts` to fix missing records
3. Successfully initialized all 15 progress stages for 120 people who had 0 records

**Results:**
- ✅ All 121 people now have 15 progress records
- ✅ Progress tracker will now show all 15 stages for everyone
- ✅ Future registrations automatically get all 15 stages (API already had this logic)

## Future Considerations

### Optional Database Cleanup:
If you want to fully remove SMS traces from the database:

```sql
-- Drop SMS logs table (optional)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sms_logs;
```

**Note**: This is optional. The table being present doesn't cause any issues.

### Re-enabling SMS (if needed):
To re-enable SMS in the future:
1. Restore `lib/mnotify.ts` from git history
2. Restore SMS API routes from git history
3. Restore SMS pages from git history
4. Add SMS menu items back to Navigation
5. Add SMS calls back to registration/progress/attendance APIs
6. Configure MNOTIFY_API_KEY environment variable
