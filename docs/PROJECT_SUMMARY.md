# FLC Sheep Seeking - Project Summary

## What Was Built

A complete, production-ready church management system for tracking member spiritual progress and attendance across 12 departments.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Two user roles: Super Admin and Sheep Seeker
- Role-based access control throughout the application
- Default admin account created during database setup

### 2. User Management
- Super Admins can create Sheep Seeker accounts
- Each Sheep Seeker is assigned to one department (month)
- Secure password hashing and token-based sessions

### 3. Member Registration
- Sheep Seekers can register new members in their department
- Automatic welcome SMS sent upon registration
- Initial progress records created for all 15 stages

### 4. Progress Tracking (15 Stages)
1. Completed New Believers School
2. Completed Soul-Winning School
3. Visited (First Quarter)
4. Visited (Second Quarter)
5. Visited (Third Quarter)
6. Baptised in Water
7. Baptised in the Holy Ghost
8. Joined Basonta or Creative Arts
9. Completed Seeing & Hearing Education
10. Introduced to Lead Pastor
11. Introduced to a First Love Mother
12. Attended Church Social Outing

15. Invited a Friend to Church

Each stage can be marked as complete/incomplete with automatic SMS notifications.
