# Group Name Mismatch Fix

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: test@test.com User Sees No Sheep ‚ùå

**Problem:**
- User `test@test.com` logged in but couldn't see any registered people (sheep)
- Dashboard showed 0 people even though there are 121 people in the database

**Root Cause:**
Group name mismatch between three places:
1. **Groups table**: Had names like `HGE-January`, `HGE-February`, etc. (with "HGE-" prefix)
2. **Registered people**: Had group names like `January`, `February`, etc. (without prefix)
3. **User assignment**: `test@test.com` was assigned to `HGE-January`

**Result**: The user was looking for people in "HGE-January" but all people were registered in "January"

### Issue 2: Navigation Components Not Showing Fully ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:**
- Navigation menu items may not be displaying correctly
- Unused import (`MessageOutlined`) from removed SMS feature

**Root Cause:**
- Leftover import from SMS feature removal
- Possible CSS caching issues from .next build folder

3. Verified the fix:
   - All groups now match: `January`, `February`, `March`, etc.

## Future Considerations

### If Adding New Groups:
When creating new groups in the future, use simple month names:
```sql
-- ‚úÖ Correct
INSERT INTO groups (name) VALUES ('January');

-- ‚ùå Wrong
INSERT INTO groups (name) VALUES ('HGE-January');
```

### When Registering People:
Always use the simple group name without any prefix:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct
group_name: 'January'

// ‚ùå Wrong  
group_name: 'HGE-January'
```

### User Assignment:
When assigning sheep seekers to groups:
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Correct
user.group_name = 'January'

// ‚ùå Wrong
user.group_name = 'HGE-January'
```
