## How to Populate

### Option 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended)

**Easiest method** - Automated with confirmation prompt:

```powershell
# In your project directory
.\scripts\populate-members.ps1
```

**What it does:**
1. ‚úì Reads database URL from .env.local
2. ‚úì Checks PostgreSQL client is installed
3. ‚úì Shows you what will be added
4. ‚úì Asks for confirmation
5. ‚úì Runs the SQL script
6. ‚úì Shows success message with breakdown

### Option 2: Direct SQL (psql)

If you have PostgreSQL client installed:

```powershell
# Set database URL
$env:DATABASE_URL = (Get-Content .env.local | Select-String "DATABASE_URL").ToString().Split('=')[1].Trim()

# Run SQL script
psql $env:DATABASE_URL -f scripts/populate-members.sql
```

### Option 3: Neon Console

If you don't have psql installed:

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Copy contents from `scripts/populate-members.sql`
5. Paste into editor
6. Click "Run"

### Option 4: Database Client

Using pgAdmin, DBeaver, or other clients:

1. Connect to your database
2. Open new SQL query window
3. Copy contents from `scripts/populate-members.sql`
4. Execute the query

## What Happens When You Run It

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Check for Admin User**
   - Script looks for a super_admin user
   - Uses that user as "registered_by" for all members

2. **Insert Members**
   - Adds 10 members to January department
   - Adds 10 members to February department
   - ... continues for all 12 departments
   - Total: 120 members

3. **Verify Count**
   - Runs a verification query
   - Shows member count per department
   - Confirms all members added successfully

### Expected Output

```sql
 department_name | member_count 
-----------------+--------------
 January         |           10
 February        |           10
 March           |           10
 April           |           10
 May             |           10
 June            |           10
 July            |           10
 August          |           10
 September       |           10
 October         |           10
 November        |           10
 December        |           10
(12 rows)
```

## After Population

### What You Can Do

1. **View Members in Dashboard**
   - Navigate to Super Admin dashboard
   - Click on any department
   - See all 10 members listed

2. **Track Progress**
   - Each member starts with 0/15 progress stages
   - Click on member to update progress
   - Mark stages as completed

3. **Record Attendance**
   - Click on any member
   - Go to Attendance tab
   - Add attendance records

4. **Test Bulk Operations**
   - Try bulk SMS features
   - Generate reports with real data
   - Test search and filter functions

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Running

1. **Backup Your Database**
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_before_population.sql
   ```

2. **Ensure You Have a Super Admin**
   - Script needs at least one super_admin user
   - This user will be set as "registered_by"
   - If you don't have one, create via registration

3. **Check Existing Data**
   - Script will ADD to existing members
   - It won't replace or delete existing data
   - Phone numbers might conflict if you have +233244123xxx numbers

### üîÑ Running Multiple Times

- Script is **idempotent-safe** for names
- Phone numbers are **NOT** checked for duplicates
- Running twice will add 240 members (120 each time)
- If you want fresh data, clean table first:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM registered_people WHERE phone_number LIKE '+233244123%';
  ```

### üìù Progress Stages

- Members are added **WITHOUT** progress records
- Progress records are created when you first view a member
- OR you can bulk initialize them separately

## Customization

### Modify the Script

Want to change member details? Edit `scripts/populate-members.sql`:

```sql
-- Change department assignment
('Kwame Mensah', '+233244123001', 'Male', 'Achimota, Accra', 'Osu, Accra', 'YOUR_DEPARTMENT'),

-- Add more members
('New Name', '+233244123121', 'Male', 'Location', 'Work', 'January'),

-- Change locations
('Same Name', 'Same Phone', 'Male', 'New Home', 'New Work', 'January'),
```

### Add More Departments

If you created custom departments:

```sql
INSERT INTO registered_people (full_name, phone_number, gender, home_location, work_location, department_name, registered_by)
SELECT 
  full_name, phone_number, gender, home_location, work_location, 'YOUR_CUSTOM_DEPT',
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'super_admin' LIMIT 1)
FROM (VALUES
  ('Member 1', '+233244999001', 'Male', 'Location', 'Work'),
  ('Member 2', '+233244999002', 'Female', 'Location', 'Work')
) AS members(full_name, phone_number, gender, home_location, work_location);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "psql: command not found"

**Problem:** PostgreSQL client not installed

**Solutions:**
1. Install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
2. Use Neon Console (Option 3 above)
3. Use pgAdmin or DBeaver

### Error: "cannot find user with role super_admin"

**Problem:** No super admin user exists

**Solution:** Create a super admin first:
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password, phone_number, role)
VALUES ('admin', '$2b$10$[your_hashed_password]', '+233244000000', 'super_admin');
```

Or register via the UI at `/api/auth/register`

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"

**Problem:** Phone numbers already exist

**Solutions:**
1. Change phone number sequence in SQL file
2. Delete existing members with those numbers
3. Use different phone number range

### Members Not Showing in Department

**Problem:** Department names don't match

**Solution:** Ensure department names in SQL match exactly:
- Case-sensitive: "January" not "january"
- No extra spaces
- Check your departments table

## Verification Queries

After population, verify with these queries:

### Count Members Per Department
```sql
SELECT department_name, COUNT(*) as member_count 
FROM registered_people 
GROUP BY department_name 
ORDER BY department_name;
```

### View Sample Members
```sql
SELECT full_name, phone_number, department_name, home_location
FROM registered_people
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Specific Department
```sql
SELECT full_name, gender, phone_number
FROM registered_people
WHERE department_name = 'January'
ORDER BY full_name;
```

### Total Members
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_members FROM registered_people;
```

## Clean Up (If Needed)

### Remove All Populated Members
```sql
DELETE FROM registered_people 
WHERE phone_number LIKE '+233244123%';
```

### Remove Specific Department
```sql
DELETE FROM registered_people 
WHERE department_name = 'January' 
  AND phone_number LIKE '+233244123%';
```

### Start Fresh (All Members)
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE registered_people CASCADE;
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This deletes ALL members and related records!

## Next Steps

After populating members:

1. ‚úÖ **Initialize Progress Stages**
   - Run progress initialization if needed
   - Each member needs 15 progress records

2. ‚úÖ **Add Sample Attendance**
   - Add some attendance records for realism
   - Test attendance tracking features

3. ‚úÖ **Test SMS Features**
   - Try sending SMS to these members
   - Test bulk SMS functionality

4. ‚úÖ **Generate Reports**
   - Run progress reports
   - View attendance statistics
   - Test department summaries

5. ‚úÖ **Update Member Details**
   - Test edit functionality
   - Try updating locations
   - Modify member information

- Ready for testing all features

**How to Run:**
```powershell
.\scripts\populate-members.ps1
